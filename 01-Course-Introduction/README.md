New Learn to Code Series on Youtube (February 2022).

I've put together a separate bonus course for you, also on Youtube.

The course on Youtube is different to this course on Udemy. Think of it as a complementary course. It starts with the absolute basics with the history of computers, binary, machine code, and give you a good overview of how computers work under the hood - The kind of information I was unable to add to this course. Take a look, I think you will enjoy it.
